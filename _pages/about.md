I am a student at NYU College of Arts and Science who is majoring in Computer Science and Data Science with a minor in Math. I plan to graduate in Spring of 2025 though I have also met the requirements to graduate in Spring of 2024 if need be. In this page, you will find some projects that I have been working on (either current or past projects) as well as my resume. You can also find some artwork that I have been working on as a hobby ever since my freshman year of high school. I'll try to update this website monthly with new artwork or coding projects. 

I am currently working on another personal site from scratch rather than using a template, I will replace this incomplete website once the other site is completely ready with my projects and their demonstrations (roughly 50% done with the other site, eta is 5/15/24)
